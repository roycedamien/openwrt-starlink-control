# luci-app-starlink

LuCI dashboard for Starlink dish telemetry, alignment, alerts, IPv6 connectivity, traffic, and router configuration on OpenWrt 25.x.
Works with Starlink Gen3 and higher dish

## Features

- **Dish Telemetry** — state, uptime, latency, packet drop, obstruction %, throughput, SNR, GPS satellites, Ethernet speed, hardware/software version
- **Alignment** — tilt and rotation guidance (↑↓ / ↻↶) with "well aligned" confirmation when within 0.1°
- **Alerts** — 11 health indicators matching the Starlink app (heating, thermal throttle, shutdown, PSU throttle, motors, mast, slow Ethernet, software update, roaming, obstruction, disabled)
- **IPv6 Connectivity** — WAN address, LAN address, delegated /56 prefix, default route
- **Traffic** — WAN and LAN byte/packet counters
- **Quality** — latency to 8.8.8.8 / 1.0.0.1, conntrack usage, router uptime
- **Configuration** — TCP congestion control, qdisc, flow offloading, MTU fix, DHCPv6-PD lifetime settings
- **Reboot Dish** button with confirmation dialog

Auto-refreshes every 10 seconds.

Note: The alignment data provided is direct from the dish API and after confirming with star-link support is more accurate than the phone app that incorrectly reports over 6 degrees misalignment and should be ignored if the dish reports its aligned.

This package is designed to work alongside [starlink-openwrt-ipv6-optimized](https://github.com/bigmalloy/starlink-openwrt-ipv6-optimized) — a companion guide and configuration reference for setting up OpenWrt as a Starlink bypass router, covering IPv6, odhcpd prefix lifetime fixes, firewall, congestion control, and more.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| OpenWrt 25.x | Uses `apk` package manager; tested on 25.12.0 |
| Architecture | `aarch64_cortex-a53` (GL-iNet Beryl AX / MT3000) — PKGARCH=all so works anywhere |
| `luci-base` | LuCI web interface |
| `rpcd` | RPC daemon (usually pre-installed) |
| `jsonfilter` | JSON parser for shell scripts |
| `grpcurl` | Required for dish telemetry — **installed automatically by the APK from v1.0.0-r5** (downloaded to `/usr/bin/grpcurl` during `apk add`) |

---

## Installation

Download the latest `.apk` from [Releases](../../releases).

```sh
# Copy to router
scp -O luci-app-starlink-1.0.0-r5.apk root@192.168.1.1:/tmp/

# Install (no key verification needed for local install)
ssh root@192.168.1.1 'apk add --allow-untrusted /tmp/luci-app-starlink-1.0.0-r5.apk'
```

The post-install script automatically downloads and installs `grpcurl`, then restarts `rpcd` and `uhttpd`. Navigate to **Network → Starlink** in the LuCI menu.

> **Note:** From v1.0.0-r5, grpcurl is downloaded and installed automatically during `apk add`. No manual steps required. If the download fails (no internet access), run `/usr/bin/install-grpcurl` manually once connected.

## Build from Source

Requires Docker.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bigmalloy/openwrt-starlink-control
cd openwrt-starlink-control
./build-apk-docker.sh
# Output: output/luci-app-starlink-*.apk
```

The build uses the official `openwrt/sdk:aarch64_cortex-a53-25.12.0-rc5` Docker image.
